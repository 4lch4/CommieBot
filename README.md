# CommieBot

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Alcha/CommieBot.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A bot idea that a friend of mine came up with. Runs a server in such a way that there are no individuals in control of the server but rather member consensus is required for all actions. Consensus is met using this bot.

## Overall Idea
The overall idea of this bot is to make a server that is run by no single individual. All privelages,
promotions, channel additions, member bans, etc., are all decided by a vote that requires a certain
percentage of approval before passing.

For example, to remove @everyone privelages, you only require a 51% consensus in order to pass.
Whereas to remove someone from a channel, you require 60%, and to pass a "Bound" exile you require
a 90% consensus.

**Bound** - Nearly every channel is blocked but the one channel for others in the same situation.
